title: Outreach
---

I consider my role as an advocate for science as a critical aspect of research and take every opportunity to participate in community outreach and science communication. This drive to share science with the public has been a theme of my life and my research career. At Auburn, there have been many opportunities to serve in this way. One of my favorite outreach activities over the years has been working with the Alabama Natural Heritage Program and the Auburn Museum of Natural History, presenting school programs and providing spider collecting experiences for children (and their adults).
