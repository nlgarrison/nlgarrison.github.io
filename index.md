I am a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University. I work in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Southeast Conservation Genetics Lab on the conservation genomics of threatened and endangered freshwater mollusks. We are located in the School of Fisheries, Aquaculture, and Aquatic Sciences.
