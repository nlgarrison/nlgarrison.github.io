I have always been fascinated with both the diversity of invertebrates and our disproportionate understanding of their biology.  Despite their abundance, ubiquity, and ecological significance we lack the most basic knowledge of many organisms in this incredible branch of the tree of life. 

I've been lucky enough to work with a diversity of critters in my research career -- crayfish, spiders, freshwater mollusks -- and each one has taught me something new. Whether I am knee deep in muck, sitting at a lab bench, or behind a computer there is a unifying theme which keeps me chipping away at this giant problem. 

We conserve only what we know; things with names, things with stories. I may not be able to make everyone love spiders, for example, but I can introduce them to the world and see where it goes. I can give them names and learn their stories. I can try.


#### Freshwater mussel conservation genomics

My current research projects seek to characterzie the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered mussel species to help develop conservation strategies and make management decisions. The U.S. Southeast is a global diversity hotspot for mussels (and crayfish, and fish, and a <a href="https://www.cepf.net/our-work/biodiversity-hotspots/north-american-coastal-plain/species"> lot of other things</a>), but they face significant anthropogenic threats and many are either going or have already gone extinct. I am using genomic methods to generate thousands of genetic markers and understand the diversity of several species (*Margaritifera hembeli*, *Cumberlandia monodonta*, *Lampsilis abrupta*, *Epioblasma brevidens*, and *Cyprogenia stegaria*).
