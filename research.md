I have always been fascinated with both the diversity of invertebrates and our disproportionate understanding of their biology.  Despite their abundance, ubiquity, and ecological significance we lack the most basic knowledge of many organisms in this incredible branch of the tree of life. Much of the diversity that exists has yet to be described. Even for many of the species which have been described, their distribution across the landscape and the genetic relationships within and between populations are not well defined.

In my research, I use a combination of genomic data and bioinformatic tools to better understand phylogenetic relationships and ask questions about evolution and speciation. I apply these modern tools to understudied invertebrates, with a focus on conservation.

#### Freshwater mussel conservation genomics

My current research projects seek to characterzie the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered mussel species to help develop conservation strategies and make management decisions. The U.S. Southeast is a global diversity hotspot for mussels (and crayfish, and fish, and a <a href="https://www.cepf.net/our-work/biodiversity-hotspots/north-american-coastal-plain/species"> lot of other things</a>), but they face significant anthropogenic threats and many are either going or have already gone extinct. I am using genomic methods to generate thousands of genetic markers and understand the diversity of several species of concern (*Margaritifera hembeli*, *Cumberlandia monodonta*, *Lampsilis abrupta*, *Epioblasma brevidens*, and *Cyprogenia stegaria*). This research should yield valuable information about patterns of diverstiy in freshwater systems and help guide captive propagation/reintroduction efforts for these species.

#### Spider systematics and phylogenetics

During my dissertation research I investigated the genetic relationships and evolution of spiders at multiple levels.  I used transcriptomic sequences to generate a backbone <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1719/"> tree of life for spiders</a>. Through my research I was able to uncover novel family-level relationships, resolve uncertainties in the previously hypothesized trees, highlight rapid diversifications of ground hunting spiders, and provide evidence for the ancient origin of the orb web. I also looked at the pattern and process of speciation within a species complex of Californian trapdoor spiders (*Aptostichus atomarius* complex) using a reduced representation genomic sequencing approach (Anchored Hybrid Enrichment). Within that complex I compared the transcriptomic profiles of dune endemic species (*A. miwok* and *A. stephencolberti*) to those of their inland sister species, identifying genes that may be associated with dune adapation.
